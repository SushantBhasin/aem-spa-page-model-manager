## Development

Run npm install to get all node_modules that are necessary for development.

### Build

```sh
$ npm run build
```

### Test

```sh
$ npm run test
```

or
```sh
$ npm run test-debug
```

### Generate docs and readme

To generate the documents in the `/out` folder and pack them in the `DOCUMENTATION.md`:

```sh
$ npm run docs
```

To generate the `README.md` based on the `DOCUMENTATION.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`:
```sh
$ npm run readme
```

### Generate Changelog

```sh
$ auto-changelog
```

### Set current version

```sh
$ npm version X.Y.Z
```
This will (in order):
* `preversion` 
  * run tests and check if `DOCUMENTATION.md` and `README.md` could be generated
* `version` 
  * set the version to `X.Y.Z`
  * generate `DOCUMENTATION.md` and `README.md` for this version
  * commit all the files in one commit named `X.Y.Z` with a tag set to `vX.Y.Z`
* `postversion`
  * push the changes and tag
